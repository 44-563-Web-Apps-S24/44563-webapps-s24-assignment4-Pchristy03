    <h1>Parker does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h3>Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekov</h3>

        <h5>TELEGIN.</h5> They have been frightened. The professor's wife won't stay here
        an hour longer. "If we are going at all, let's be off," says she, "we
        shall go to Kharkoff and look about us, and then we can send for our
        things." They are travelling light. It seems, Marina, that fate has
        decreed for them not to live here.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>MARINA.</h5> And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was
        shameful!
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>TELEGIN.</h5> It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>MARINA.</h5> I wish I'd never laid eyes on them. <p>[A pause]</p> Now we shall have
        things as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in
        the evening; everything in order as decent folks, as Christians like to
        have it. <p>[Sighs]</p> It is a long time since I have eaten noodles.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>TELEGIN.</h5> Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. <p>[A pause]</p> Not for ages.
        As I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the
        shop-keepers called after me, "Hi! you hanger-on!" I felt it bitterly.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>MARINA.</h5> Don't pay the least attention to them, master; we are all
        dependents on God. You and Sonia and all of us. Every one must work, no
        one can sit idle. Where is Sonia?
        </p>

        <p>
        <h5>TELEGIN.</h5> In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he
        may lay violent hands on himself.
